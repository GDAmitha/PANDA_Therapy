# Anxiety Management Techniques

## Breathing Exercises

Deep breathing is one of the most effective ways to reduce anxiety quickly. The 4-7-8 technique works as follows:
1. Inhale through your nose for 4 seconds
2. Hold your breath for 7 seconds
3. Exhale slowly through your mouth for 8 seconds
4. Repeat 3-5 times

## Grounding Techniques

When feeling anxious or overwhelmed, try the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique:
- Identify 5 things you can see
- Identify 4 things you can touch
- Identify 3 things you can hear
- Identify 2 things you can smell
- Identify 1 thing you can taste

This helps bring your awareness back to the present moment.

## Progressive Muscle Relaxation

Tense and then release each muscle group in your body, starting from your toes and working up to your head. Hold the tension for 5 seconds, then release for 10 seconds, noticing the difference between tension and relaxation.

## Cognitive Reframing

Identify negative thought patterns and challenge them by:
1. Recognizing the thought
2. Examining the evidence for and against it
3. Considering alternative perspectives
4. Developing a more balanced thought

## Mindfulness Meditation

Practice focused attention on the present moment without judgment. Start with just 5 minutes daily and gradually increase. Focus on your breath, bodily sensations, or use guided meditations.
